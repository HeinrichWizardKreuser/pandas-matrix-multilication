This notebook shows how a list of users with a list of constraints for Bed and Breakfast places (BNBs) can be paired with a list of BNBs that satisfy the constraints by performing a matrix multiplication to get the satisfaction matrix and then perform the Classical Assignment Problem algorithm on that matrix to get the pairings of users with BNBs where the user's constraints are satisfied as much as possible
